# Overview

ChatKitty provides a Platform API, and client JavaScript SDK to directly interact with your ChatKitty 
application. 

[The JavaScript client library](https://docs.chatkitty.com/javascript/) provides an asynchronous 
WebSocket based real-time messaging interface to ChatKitty's user-side functionality. While the client 
SDK handle the requests and responses at the client-side, [the Platform API](https://docs.chatkitty.com/platform/) 
provides an RESTful HTTP interface for you to manage and control your application server-side.

<aside class="notice">
 The Platform API is not designed for client-side use.
