# Overview

ChatKitty provides a client JavaScript SDK and Platform API for you to interact with your ChatKitty 
application. 

[The JavaScript client library](https://docs.chatkitty.com/javascript/) provides an asynchronous 
WebSocket based real-time messaging interface to ChatKitty's user-side functionality. [The Platform API](https://docs.chatkitty.com/platform/) 
provides a RESTful HTTP interface for you to manage and control your application server-side.

<aside class="notice">
 The Platform API is not designed for client-side use.
